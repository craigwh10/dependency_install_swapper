- Throwing in the content script is best practice if something unexpected happens.
- The content scripts aren't run so errors won't show if an error should run
    - For example if the script can't find the install cmd then we should throw as that definitive behaviour.
    - So elements we should work under confidence and assert they're defined to prevent crazy branching.
